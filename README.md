# 4-bit-up-down-counter-rtl-to-gds-vlsi-design-flow
This project implements a 4-bit up/down counter through the complete RTL to GDSII VLSI design flow. The design is written in Verilog, functionally verified, synthesized with timing constraints, and physically implemented through floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and sign-off to generate a final GDSII layout.
